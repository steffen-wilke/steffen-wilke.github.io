Video games are my passion. I dumped thousands of hours into playing and as a kid, I wanted to be a professional Gamer because Esports always fascinated me.

When I'm not sitting infront of a Computer, I like to to treat myself with some fine food or enjoy a bavarian [Wei√übier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_beer).
